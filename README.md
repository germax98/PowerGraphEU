# PowerGraphEU

# Description 
PowerGraphEU is a full-stack web application that allows users to compare the real-time energy production of fossil and renewable energies of all European countries. The project was a study project and was produced through teamwork. The work was divided into the backend and frontend. My part of the work was creating the UI/UX design and implementing the frontend. My team partner took care of the backend development.


## Frontend 

The website consists of three different pages.

1. The Overview page displays the current energy production of the selected country and provides data on the country's current renewable and fossil energy production.

2. The Devices page could not be completed due to time constraints. The idea was to create various devices to determine their charging cycle so that they could be powered by renewable energy.

3. The Charts page allows the user to compare the energy production of individual European countries. The data is displayed using Chart JS.

### Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Chart JS

### Backend

The backend was developed using Python with the Flask framework, which enables the interface between the frontend and backend. An API request is also made in the backend to receive the data. The data is analyzed in the backend and saved using MongoDB. The entire project was then hosted locally on a Raspberry Pi.

### Technologies Used:

- Python
- Flask
- MongoDB
- Rasberry Pie
